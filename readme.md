# DMD-Net: Deep Mesh Denoising Network

This repository contains a personal implementation inspired by the DMD_Net paper:
[DMD-Net: Deep Mesh Denoising Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22850). The code here is written independently, based solely on my understanding of the ideas describled in the paper.
